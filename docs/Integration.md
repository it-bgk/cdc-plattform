## Cortex
### NSLR
If you want to activate NSLR I created for you `./DATA/cortex/nslr` where you can store the NSLR files manually.
I cannot add this files into the image. Because the image will then to big.
To see how you can use it please go to: `https://github.com/TheHive-Project/CortexDocs/blob/master/analyzer_requirements.md#nslr`
