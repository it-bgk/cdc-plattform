# Project: cdc-plattform
This plattform should help cyber security teams, cyber defense center and all other which want to improve their security incident processes with tools, but have to less man power to do this on their own.
All the tools I use are free to use and can be used without any dependencies of this project.

The goal of the project is to make the installation and maintenance easier to setup and use the tools listed in [contribution](#contribution).
